# note-taker

This project is a web application that allows users to create and save notes.

## Description

This project is a web application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. It uses Heroku to be deployed live. It's purpose is to showcase my current knowledge of javascript and node.js and highlight certain proficiencies such as:

- Express.js
- routing
- Heroku deployment
- GET/POST/DELETE requests

## Usage

To use the note taker you can visit https://secret-spire-42264.herokuapp.com/ and click 'Get Started'. You will be presented with current notes in the left-hand column and you can add your own notes to the middle fields. After you have filled in your note simply click the save icon in the upper right-hand corner and your new note title will appear with the other note titles in the left-hand column. To recall a note, click on the title. You can also delete a note by clicking on the delete icon to the right of the title.
